# Portfolio

This pillar defines the products, solutions, and the structure of the company's offering. The Portfolio operates at three altitudes. The portfolio level speaks broadly about the offering and its structure. The product level introduces specific capabilities and differentiation. The solution level grounds everything in real jobs-to-be-done and measurable outcomes. Most content should start at the solution or portfolio level and introduce product specifics only when they're needed to support a claim.

## Messaging Blocks

### Portfolio Overview

[Instructions:
Describe the high-level structure of your offering — the relationship between products, how they compose into a whole, and what the buyer is actually purchasing. This is especially important for multi-product companies, platform + module architectures, and product-led companies with free and paid tiers.]

[Tips:
- Prioritize structure over detail — feature-level discussion belongs in product profiles
- Make hierarchy explicit: what's the platform, what's a module, what's an add-on, what's standalone
- If the portfolio has evolved through acquisition, note which products are native vs. acquired — this affects integration messaging]

[Format:
- **Structure:** [single product | multi-product | platform + modules | product + services]
- **Hierarchy:** [describe the relationship — e.g., "Platform is the core, vuln-mgmt and asset-inventory are modules, professional services is standalone"]
- **Packaging:** [how it's sold — bundled, à la carte, tiered, enterprise-only]

## Collection Tables

Reference tables routing to deeper collection detail. The pillar carries the substantive messaging above; collections carry the per-instance detail. Each row resolves to a file in `messaging/collections/<type>/`.

### Products

Products are the canonical units of offering within the portfolio. Reference products intentionally — only when they're relevant to the scenario, persona, or use case. When specific products are related to your task, extract the respective profile in `messaging/collections/products/` for in-depth messaging.

| Product | File | Type | Status | Parent | Description |
|---------|------|------|--------|--------|-------------|
|         |      |      |        |        |             |

[Instructions:
List each product as a row in the reference table and create a discrete profile in `messaging/collections/products/[product-name].md`. Type and Status are enums. Parent references the parent product for modules and add-ons (leave empty for top-level products). Description should be a routing signal — one sentence (~15 words) capturing what this product does and why it matters, not just its name.]

[Tips:
- Type: platform | product | module | add-on | service
- Status: ga | beta | planned | deprecated
- Parent makes the hierarchy navigable — a module launch campaign needs to reference its parent platform
- Only create product profiles for offerings with distinct messaging — if two products always go to market together with identical positioning, they may be one profile
- Pricing model, if it differs from the portfolio default, belongs in the product profile frontmatter — not the pillar table]

### Solutions

Solutions are the use cases of the product in practice — real jobs-to-be-done scenarios where the portfolio delivers meaningful and measurable value. They bridge the gap between product capabilities and buyer outcomes.

Use solutions to ground messaging in what teams are trying to accomplish. A product profile says what it does. A solution profile says what you can achieve with it.

When specific solutions are related to your task, extract the respective profile in `messaging/collections/solutions/` for in-depth messaging.

| Solution | File | Scope | Products | Description |
|----------|------|-------|----------|-------------|
|          |      |       |          |             |

[Instructions:
Document repeatable, outcome-oriented solutions. Solutions may span multiple products or apply to a single product. For each, carve out a distinct profile in `messaging/collections/solutions/[solution-name].md`. Description should lead with the strategic theme (e.g., consolidation, risk reduction) and capture the outcome — one sentence (~15 words).]

[Tips:
- Scope: single-product (one product delivers this) | cross-product (requires multiple products) | platform (the platform as a whole delivers this)
- Products: which product(s) power this solution — reference by slug
- Only create a solution profile when the use case has its own messaging — distinct audience, distinct proof, distinct value framing. If a use case is just a feature of a product, it belongs in the product profile, not here
- When you have many solutions, group them by theme to avoid messaging sprawl]

## Writing Guidelines

[Instructions:
3-5 rules for how this pillar's voice and narrative should be applied — interpretation calls, constraints, and strategic choices unique to this company.]

[Tips: 
Favor rules that change what an agent produces — what to lead with, what to avoid leading with, which claims are off-limits, and what to defer to when sources conflict.]
